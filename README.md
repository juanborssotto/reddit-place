# Reddit place

My attempt to recreate reddit place -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_(Reddit) 

Run with npm(If ERR_BLOCKED_BY_CLIENT is giving by browser, try disabling Adblock, uBlock, or any other ad blocker extension)
```shell
$ npm run make
`````
```shell
$ npm run start
`````

If you want to disable the time delay to paint pixels, change config/userConfig.ts
